Details

You are working as a front-end developer at a marketing agency. The design team has created a new layout for a client's web site. 
Their previous website was done several years back, and was not responsive. Not only do they want an attractive site featuring homes, 
but they want to ensure it is usable on all screen sizes.

Below, find the mockup from the design team. They have given us a good amount to work with.

To get the colors right, either choose an online color picker, or download a program (like Gimp) 
that allows you to choose colors from a picture and tells you their hex values.

The designers didn't specify fonts for us, but want us to get as close as we can to their design images. 
They want to use free fonts, so you thought you could help the team save money by using Google Fonts.

You are pretty sure these can be included on web pages pretty easily. 
Also, they are open source / free to use, plus since many sites use Google fonts, some users may already have these c
ached on their computers, making the page ultimately faster to load than if using a completely custom font.

Stretch Tasks

Once you've got the basic layout implemented and responsive, it's time to add some pizzazz. Experiment using different CSS techniques to accentuate boxes when the mouse is over them, and/or look into using transitions to make them smoothly animated!

 Explore using :hover and CSS transitions to make the site more dynamic
 After you have finished the homepage you can try expanding your design and creating other pages linked from the homepage
 Experiment using additional Bootstrap components that we haven't explored in class
